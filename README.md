We're redesigning the old website for the Code for Boulder Brigade, in order to facilitate:

- Membership
- New Projects
- Advertisement of Older Projects
- The distrbution of knowledge, through the blog

If you need jekyll, use `gem install jekyll` to install jekyll.

To run and show the project as it stands, go to your nearest terminal and `bundle exec jekyll serve`
